# Snuk Challenges

The Snuk Challenge is an opportunity to demonstrate proficiency with problem solving and collaboration skills we would expect you to use at Snuk.

The Challenge creates a foundation for further onsite collaboration during your interview. Additionally, we want you to get a feel for some of the most common tasks you'll encounter at Snuk.


## How to complete a Challenge

* Select a challenge and create a new git repository for that project.
* Organize your work within that repository. When you get to a stopping point, archive the repository (or publish it, if you prefer) and send it to us.


#### Time

We respect your time and don't want you spending more than 3 hours on your challenge.
We just want to get a sense of your thought process and the way you do the work.
If there are features you don't have time to implement, feel free to describe the intended approach to implementation in the README.


#### Your Challenge README

Include the following in your README:

* A description of the problem and solution.
* The reasoning behind your technical choices: trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you had additional time.
* What you'd do next and why.


## What We Care About

Reviewing the application we'll look at the following aspects:

* **Clarity:** Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
* **Correctness:** Does the submission accomplish what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Quality:** Is the solution **simple**, easy to understand, and maintainable? Is it aligned with the community-accepted way of solving similar problems?
* **Technical Choices:** Do choices of libraries, algorithms, and architecture seem appropriate for the challenge?
* **Testing:** If required, what testing approach was taken? Will the tests be difficult to change if the requirements of the application changed?
